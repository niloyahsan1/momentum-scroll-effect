# Momentum Scroll Effect

This project demonstrates a custom momentum like scroll effect (with custom) where the content scrolls smoothly and with inertia and provides a more interactive and visually appealing scrolling experience.

## Features

- **Momentum Scrolling:** The page scrolls with a smooth momentum effect, simulating the natural feeling of inertia.
- **Custom Scrollbar:** The scrollbar is custom designed with a dynamic thumb that adjusts its size and position based on the page scroll.
- **Full-Screen Sections:** The content is divided into fullscreen sections, making it suitable for visually rich, scroll driven websites or landing pages.
